* Tau
A front-end alternative for various streaming sites. It leverages the excellent [[https://github.com/TeamNewPipe/NewPipeExtractor][NewPipe Extractor]] library that powers the popular [[https://github.com/TeamNewPipe/NewPipe][NewPipe]] Android app. Tau exposes the extracted data over a REST API that is consumed by a local re-frame SPA.

To run the application, first compile the downloader ahead-of-time.

#+begin_src sh
clojure -M -e "(compile 'tau.downloader-impl)"
#+end_src

Fetch the front-end dependencies and build the front-end assets.

#+begin_src sh
npm i
npm run build
#+end_src

Then, compile the front-end.

#+begin_src sh
clojure -M:frontend compile tau
#+end_src

You can now start a local server that listens on port 3000 by running the following:

#+begin_src sh
clojure -M:run
#+end_src

Access the front-end in your browser at =https://localhost:3000=.
