* Tubo
Tubo is a streaming front-end focused on bringing the [[https://github.com/TeamNewPipe/NewPipe][NewPipe]] experience to the web. It currently supports the same platforms as NewPipe, including YouTube, SoundCloud, and more.

To retrieve the data, it wraps the excellent [[https://github.com/TeamNewPipe/NewPipeExtractor][NewPipe Extractor]] library and exposes the extracted data over a REST API that is consumed by a local re-frame SPA.

** Try It Out
You can try a live demo at https://tubo.mianmoreno.com but beware this is hosted on a personal low-end VPS. If you can, please consider self-hosting Tubo and let me know about your instance via the [[*Contributing][contribution methods]]. See [[*Installation][installation]] for ways to set up Tubo in your server.

** Installation
*** Manual
The easiest way to set up Tubo's dependencies is via the [[https://guix.gnu.org/][GNU Guix]] package manager. Simply invoke what follows:

#+begin_src sh
cd /path/to/tubo
guix shell
#+end_src

To run the application, first compile the downloader ahead-of-time.

#+begin_src sh
clojure -M -e "(compile 'tubo.downloader-impl)"
#+end_src

Fetch the front-end dependencies and build the front-end assets.

#+begin_src sh
npm i
npm run build
#+end_src

Then, compile the front-end.

#+begin_src sh
clojure -M:frontend compile tubo
#+end_src

You can now start a local server that listens on port 3000 by running the following:

#+begin_src sh
clojure -M:run
#+end_src

Access the front-end in your browser at =http://localhost:3000=.
